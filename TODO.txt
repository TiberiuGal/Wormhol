These things were on the top of my head when I released Wormhol v1.0.
- remove excessive debug trace
- D2?
- IA players
- ATI compatibility
- Torii
- Arbitrary mesh as surfaces?
- Editable levels?
- Rebindable keys
- Joystick support
- More speed
- One-click installer
- A replacement for this Black Ugly Background©
- configuration and logging should go in a proper, writable directory (Windows Seven)
- whatever...
